# Google Stock

Suppose you are given a list of integers, `prices`, that represent the price of Google's stock over time. `prices[i]` is the price of the stock on day `i`. You must buy the stock once and then later sell it. You are not allowed to sell before you buy.

Write a function that returns an integer, which is the maximum profit you can make from buying the stock and then later selling it. If the list is empty, return `0`.

Example input:

``` js
prices = [6, 0, -1, 10]
```

Example output:

``` js
11
```

Explanation:

```
11 is the maximum profit you can make by buying the stock when it's -1 and selling it when it's 10.
```
