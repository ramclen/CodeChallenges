# K Largest Number

Given an array of numbers find the `k`th largest number.

If there are duplicates in the array, return the `k`th element if the array were sorted in descending order, not the `k`th largest distinct number.

Example input: 

```js
nums: [1, 4, 3, 4, 2, 5]
k: 3
```

Output: 

```
4
```

```
The largest elements are [5, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1]. The 3rd element is 4.
