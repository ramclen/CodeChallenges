# Diagonal Difference

Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix arr is shown below:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  
```

The left-to-right diagonal = 1 + 5 + 9 = 15. The right to left diagonal = 3 + 5 + 9 = 17. Their absolute difference is |15 - 17| = 2.

## Function description

Complete the `diagonalDifference` function in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the absolute diagonal difference.

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:

- arr: an array of integers .

## Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, N, the number of rows and columns in the matrix `arr`.
Each of the next N lines describes a row, arr[i], and consists of N space-separated integers arr[i][j].

## Output Format

Print the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.
