# ReceivingIsThisApp

You're working on a chat app for `WhatlsThisApp`. Someone from your team has committed this code, but there's a problem with it: the `Receiver` doesn't seem to be receiving any messages.

The manager on your team has asked if you can look into this problem to resolve the issue. Can you get the code into a working state?
